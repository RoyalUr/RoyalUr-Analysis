The Royal Game of Ur in [docs/Insights.md](/docs/Insights.md)!


# 🧐 Analyse your own positions
If you'd like to analyse your own positions, just open the RoyalUrAnalysis.jar
file, and it will open a window where you can input a game position. You can
then click _Analyse_ and it will analyse the position using the same AI used for
the royalur.net Panda difficulty! In the future, we plan to add support for
analysing the positions using more AI's as well.

In the window simply click any details you want to change about the position,
and they will toggle between their possible states.


# 🤖 Meet the Agents
We currently have a small set of agents designed to play The Royal Game of Ur,
and each takes a slightly different approach to picking their moves!

| Agent | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [Random](/docs/Agents.md#-the-random-agent-)         | Picks a random move, every time! |
| [First-Move](/docs/Agents.md#-the-first-move-agent-) | Picks the least advanced piece to move. |
| [Last-Move](/docs/Agents.md#-the-last-move-agent-)   | Picks the most advanced piece to move. |
| [Greedy](/docs/Agents.md#-the-greedy-agent-)         | Prioritises taking pieces, and moving onto rosettes. |
| [Expectimax](/docs/Agents.md#-the-expectimax-agent-) | Does a statistical analysis to determine the best move. |
| [Panda](/docs/Agents.md#-the-panda-agent-)           | A cheaper variant of expectimax that skips checking some rolls. |

If you'd like to delve deeper into each agent, how they function, and more statistics
about each of them, then check out [docs/Agents.md](/docs/Agents.md) for more information!


# 🥊 Challenge the AI's yourself
If you'd like to challenge the [Panda Agent](/docs/Agents.md#-the-panda-agent-),
the website [RoyalUr.net](https://royalur.net) has the _Extreme_ difficulty,
which uses the RoyalUrAnalysis Panda Agent under the hood!
