# üé≤ The Royal Game of Ur Analysis
This repository is dedicated to the technical analysis of
[The Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur).

The Royal Game of Ur is an ancient Sumerian board game discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in a
tomb in ancient Ur in 1922. The game dates back to **over 4000 years ago**, and is considered
by many to be the oldest board game in the world. This repository contains code with the goal
of analysing this old game, and determining how much of the game is luck, and how much is skill.

# üìà Current Rankings

here are there current rankings:

| ----- | -------------- |
| [Expectimax](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/ExpectimaxAgent.java) (Depth 5)  | 87.5% |
| [Expectimax](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/ExpectimaxAgent.java) (Depth 3)  | 77.6% |
| [Greedy](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/GreedyAgent.java)                    | 61.3% |
| [Last-Move](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/LastMoveAgent.java)               | 50.0% |
| [Random](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/RandomAgent.java)                    | 23.5% |
| [First-Move](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/FirstMoveAgent.java)             | 0.1%  |

These results may not show us the best way to play the game yet, but they definitely
tell us the worst. If you want to lose every game you play, there is no better
strategy than always playing the first possible move you can!

# üçÄ So, how much of the game is luck?
To quantify this question, here are the results of playing a very simple greedy strategy
against our current best strategy: expectimax with a search depth of 7. This should give
us a good idea of how lucky you have to be when playing a very simple strategy to beat
someone playing very well.

**So, what are the results?**

| Agent | Win Percentage |
| ----- | -------------- |
| [Expectimax](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/ExpectimaxAgent.java) (Depth 7)  | 85% |
| [Greedy](src/main/java/com/sothatsit/royalur/ai/GreedyAgent.java)                    | 15% |

This suggests that even if you are a world-class Game of Ur player, there is always a
chance that someone with very meagre skills could still win! This is part of what makes
The Royal Game of Ur such an approachable and exciting game, with matches often coming
down to the wire.
