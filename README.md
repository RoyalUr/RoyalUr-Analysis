# üé≤ The Royal Game of Ur Analysis
This repository is dedicated to the technical analysis of
[The Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur).

The Royal Game of Ur is an ancient Sumerian board game discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in a
tomb in ancient Ur in 1922. The game dates back to **over 4000 years ago**, and is considered
by many to be the oldest board game in the world. This repository contains code with the goal

# ü§ñ The Agents
We currently have a small set of agents designed to play The Royal Game of Ur.

| Agent | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [Random](/docs/Agents.md#-the-random-agent-)          | Picks a random move, every time! |
| [First-Move](/docs/Agents.md#-the-first-move-agent-)  | Picks the least advanced piece to move. |
| [Last-Move](/docs/Agents.md#-the-last-move-agent-)    | Picks the most advanced piece to move. |
| [Greedy](/docs/Agents.md#-the-greedy-agent-)          | Prioritises taking pieces, and moving onto rosettes. |
| [Expectimax](/docs/Agents.md#-the-expectimax-agent-)  | Does a statistical analysis to determine the best move. |

If you'd like to delve deeper into each agent and how they function,
check out [docs/Agents.md](/docs/Agents.md) for more information!


# üìà Current Rankings
There are currently only a few agents implemented to play the game,
and here are their rankings:

| Agent | Win Percentage |
| ----- | -------------- |
| [Expectimax](/docs/Agents.md#-the-expectimax-agent-) (Depth 5)  | 87.5% |
| [Expectimax](/docs/Agents.md#-the-expectimax-agent-) (Depth 3)  | 77.6% |
| [Greedy](/docs/Agents.md#-the-greedy-agent-)                    | 61.3% |
| [Last-Move](/docs/Agents.md#-the-last-move-agent-)              | 50.0% |
| [Random](/docs/Agents.md#-the-random-agent-)                    | 23.5% |

tell us the worst. If you want to lose every game you play, there is no better
strategy than always moving your least advanced piece!

# üçÄ So, how much of the game is luck?
To quantify this question, here are the results of playing a very simple greedy strategy
against our current best strategy: depth-7 expectimax. This should give us a good idea of
how lucky you have to be when playing a very simple strategy to beat someone playing very well.

| Agent | Win Percentage |
| ----- | -------------- |
| [Expectimax](/docs/Agents.md#-the-expectimax-agent-) (Depth 7)  | 85% |
| [Greedy](/docs/Agents.md#-the-greedy-agent-)                    | 15% |

These results suggest that even if you are a world-class Game of Ur player, there is _always_
a chance that someone with very meagre skills could still win! This is part of what makes
The Royal Game of Ur such an approachable and exciting game, with matches often coming
down to the wire even with big skill disparities.


# üâê Does playing first give you an advantage?
Another question that people may wonder, is whether playing as light or dark gives you
an advantage in your games? Well, we ran the numbers by playing two depth-5 expectimax
agents against one another, and here are the results:

| Colour | Win Percentage |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Light  | 61.9%          |
| Dark   | 38.1%          |

From these results you can see that playing as light gives you a significant advantage
when playing The Royal Game of Ur, with a whopping 23.8% higher chance of winning!
